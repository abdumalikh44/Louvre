## About The Project

In this project, 
we're making a CRUD application. 
The area we're going to application CRUD is a Hotel Management System. 
Where the problem we found was when the user had to input data like 
"INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');" that method too much take a time. So, we made user interface using Python (GUI) and the user doesn't have to make a code again.

## Built With (Tech Stack)

 - [MySQL üê¨](https://www.mysql.com/) - For handling database and queries
 - [Python üêç](https://www.python.org/) - For running the main application code
 - [MySQL Connector Python ](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/t) - For querying MySQL through python
 - [Tkinter & Tkk üé®](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html) - For the user interface


## Getting Started

The first thing you have to do is install this library.

```bash
!pip install mysql-connector-python
```
Or for information about installing connector to python, you can click this ![Connector](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-installation.html)


Then open the file through Visual Studio or another text editor support Python 3 and Tkinter.

<b>PS:</b> You have to put the file `MainMenu1.py`, `SearchData.py`, `Table1.py`, and `Table2.py` in same folder.

Don't forget to execute `Louvre.sql` in MySQL Workbench!

### 1. Main Menu

This is the main menu. You can fill data in form booking and form customers. After you fill data, then you can click the button "Submit". The function of button Submit is to store data in MySQL
