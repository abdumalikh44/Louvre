## About The Project

In this project, 
we're making a CRUD application. 
The area we're going to application CRUD is a Hotel. 
Where the problem we found was when the user had to input data like 
"INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');" that method too much take a time. So, we made user interface using Python (GUI) and the user doesn't have to make a code again.
